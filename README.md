<h1>All About Me, Heidy Li</h1>
<p>
hello, my name is Heidy Li! If you're seeing this, then congrats: i know you well enough. This website is intended for people who want to know me better cuz i get the feeling that yall find me scary or something. (people have called me scary and frowny and such)
Here you will find some stuff about me in simple html until i get better at doing stuff like this. This will also be a test for my coding and creating skills. 
</p>
<h3>Now that you know the basics... i'm going to do a <em>formal</em> introduction</h3>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Heidy. I am currently in the <em>10th grade</em> at <span style="color= blue;">Glenda Dawson High School</span>. <em>(im not going to flex here cuz this is a pretend intro :skull:)</em>

<h3>Here is my <span style="color= red;"><em>informal</em></span>introduction</h3>
<h4>(this is what i recommend you take into heart)</h4>
<p>
  Hello, i'm Heidy Li! I'm your aspring shenanigan doer from Pearland, TX. I do stuff like drawing (check out my ig ay), sleeping, and wasting away. I might look tired and depressed and angry; most times i am not. Very rarely am i bothered. I literally have to put this here because no one will listen. I actually might have to work on this :skull:. Hey, you can actually check out my <a href="https://heidyl.carrd.co/">website here</a> if you have time (press ctrl and click), but this is mostly for my art and commission thingamabobs. It's a work in progress, but so am i and this website. :smile:
