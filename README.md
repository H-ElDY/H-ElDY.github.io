  Hello, i'm Heidy Li! I'm your aspring shenanigan doer from Pearland, TX. I do stuff like drawing (check out my ig ay), sleeping, and wasting away. I might look tired and depressed and angry; most times i am not. Very rarely am i bothered. I literally have to put this here because no one will listen. I actually might have to work on this :skull:. Hey, you can actually check out my <a href="https://heidyl.carrd.co/">website here</a> if you have time (press ctrl and click), but this is mostly for my art and commission thingamabobs. It's a work in progress, but so am i and this website. :smile:

<h3>BEFORE YOU ASK ME I AM AN INTP-T!! IK THIS WAS THE REASON I MADE THIS BUT i don't like how these personalities work. They are ambiguous and are only existent when the view is toward the general population, and even then they are not accurate in determining everything!</h3>
<h3>Negative Adjectives about me:</h3>
ik youre tired about the positive adjectives cuz they can literally apply to basically anyone at a point. so here are my negatives:
<li>I am INSENSITIVE!!</li>
  <ul>Yes, i may just say something very thoughtless and inconsiderate! I'm sorry if this ever is going to happen or happen to you, but please don't blame me cuz tHe pErSonAlItY qUiZ sAiD sO (i might, at that moment, underestimate your emotions or something)</ul>
  <li>I am UNSATISFIED!!</li>
  <ul>Again, i might let the impatient alpha wolf inside me do the job.</ul>
  <li>I am a great OVERTHINKER!!</li>
  <ul>I am <b>prone</b> to this! It's not that i might, I do have OCD or am on a spectrum of it, and it is prevalent in my dermatophagia <span class="spoiler">severe biting of skin around nails.</span> if you want more proof of this, it falls under the DSM5's Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders.</ul>
  <li>I am UNEMPLOYED!</li>
  <ul>it is what it is</ul>
