<h2>Sunscreen: for the poorly educated members of North American society!</h2>
<p>As someone who unwillingly spends dozens of hours a week outside, and who actually lives on the face of earth where the sun is a paramount part of daily life, I am susceptible to multiple types of skin cancers.To elaborate, skin cancers are bad. 
  
  Melanoma, basal sell carcinoma, all bad. Not good.

Unfortunately the FDA determines that sunscreen is a drug and treats it as such. 
There are not as much regulations on sunscreen as there are on food. 
So therefore, there has got to be some bad sunscreens out there. 
But lucky you, after you so greatly found me and my reasearch, do not fret. Education is ahead. 

So what--why do you need sunscreen? 
Skin cancer is caused by UV rays. UV messes with your dna. Tanning is literally a bodily measure to prevent cancers.
